# Welcome!

This is my personal braindump site where I collect:

- **Code snippets** I find useful
- **Quick technical notes** and solutions
- **Project starters** and scaffolding examples
- **Random musings** about programming

## Why This Exists

I got tired of:
- Losing track of useful code snippets
- Forgetting solutions to problems I've already solved
- Not having a central place for my starter templates

So here we are. This is my digital second brain.

## What to Expect

Don't expect polished, long-form articles (though they might happen). This is more of a:
- Quick reference
- Personal wiki
- Code library
- Thinking space

Feel free to explore!
