    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    
    <p>This is my personal braindump — a place where I collect code snippets, technical notes, and project starters that I find useful.</p>
    
    <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Snipdumps:</strong> Reusable code patterns and solutions, could be smaller than a gist and larger than a snippet. OK to be fair... these keep me from writing Blog posts :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:</li>
      <li><strong>Blog Posts:</strong> Technical writings and tutorials (when I feel like it)</li>
      <li><strong>Project Starters:</strong> Scaffolding and boilerplate projects. You might want to fork these you little scrounger!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
    
    <p>This site is built with:</p>
